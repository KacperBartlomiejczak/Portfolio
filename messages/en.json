    "description": "Hi, I'm Kacper — a frontend developer from Toruń who treats code like a hobby horse race: with full commitment and a bit of healthy madness. I build fast and accessible sites in React/Next.js, optimizing every millisecond like it's a personal challenge. By day, I study Computer Science at UMK; by night, I test ideas at hackathons and in cafes (preferably ones with fast Wi-Fi and even faster espresso ☕). Yes, that's me on a hobby horse in the photo — because life's too short to take everything seriously, but code? Code should always be clean, performant, and pixel-perfect.",
