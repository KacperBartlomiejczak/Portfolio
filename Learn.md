# Project Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a frontend developer. It serves as a central hub for my professional presence online, featuring a clean, modern, and performant user interface.

# Technology Stack

The project is built with a modern, React-based technology stack, prioritizing performance, developer experience, and scalability.

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **UI Library**: [React](https://react.dev/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Animations**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- **Components**: [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for accessible, unstyled primitives.
- **Linting**: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- **Form Handling**: [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- **Notifications**: [React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/)
- **Email Service**: [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) for the contact form.

# Key Learnings

Building this portfolio was a significant learning experience. Here are some of the key takeaways:

1.  **Performance Optimization in Next.js**: I gained hands-on experience with Next.js performance features. A key focus was on optimizing Core Web Vitals, particularly the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). I learned how to properly use `next/font` to manage local fonts, preventing render-blocking requests and avoiding layout shifts.

2.  **SEO with the App Router**: I delved deep into the Next.js Metadata API to implement robust SEO. This included generating static and dynamic metadata, setting up canonical URLs, defining Open Graph and Twitter card information, and configuring `robots.txt` for optimal search engine indexing.

3.  **Component-Based Architecture**: I reinforced my skills in building a scalable and maintainable application by creating a well-organized structure of reusable React components. I focused on separating concerns, creating everything from simple UI primitives (like buttons and inputs) to more complex, feature-specific components.

4.  **Advanced Styling with Tailwind CSS**: I went beyond basic utility classes and learned how to effectively use Tailwind CSS for creating a custom, consistent design system. I utilized `tailwind-merge` and `class-variance-authority` to build flexible and conflict-free UI components.

5.  **Accessibility (a11y)**: By integrating Radix UI components, I learned the importance of building with accessibility in mind from the start. Using these unstyled, accessible primitives ensured that the core components of the application, like dialogs and labels, were compliant with WAI-ARIA standards.

6.  **Modern Development Workflow**: I solidified my understanding of a modern frontend workflow, including TypeScript for type safety, ESLint for code quality, and a structured approach to project organization that enhances long-term maintainability.
